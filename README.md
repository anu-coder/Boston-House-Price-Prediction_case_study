# Boston House Prices Prediction: A case study
**Solo project by Anurima Dey**

 A case study on the prediction modelling of the house prices of Boston using various machine learning techniques. 
 
 ## Purpose:
 
I started my journey of understanding the machine learning algorithms using this project. In the confusion of what to start with "clssification", "regression", I thought why not start with a alphabet having a higher ASCII value, which is "R", i.e. regression....(Uhha!! Random logic, whatever). Well but the main purpose was to understand a regression problem (i.e  when we are predicting a continuous variable) and applying machine learning techniques to obtain the objective. Here the continuous variable is the MEDV (median value of the owner occupied homes). BHPP is also a beginners project to deploy a data analyst career, as enlisted by Kaggle. 

## Objective: 

Let be precise: 
1. Obtaining and cleaning the data.
2. Data Exploration and Data Visualization
3.
